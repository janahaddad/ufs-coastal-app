Overview

UFS Coastal Application (ufs-coastal-app) is a modeling framework for coastal applications and regional forecasts. It consists of coupled modeling components that link the atmospheric, ocean and terrestrial realms under one common framework. UFS Coastal Application is a flexible and portable modeling system. Flexibility means that additional modeling components can be added with ease and portability means that UFS Coastal Application can be built and run under different computing environments and operating systems. The `UFS Coastal Model <https://github.com/oceanmodeling/ufs-coastal>_` inherits underlying infrastructure and set of physical model components from `UFS Weather Model <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-weather-model>_` and extends the model by including new `ESMF/NUOPC <https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf.git>_` based physical components that are specialized for coastal applications.
